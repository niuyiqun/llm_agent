After that, make an attempt to head east. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, go to the east. If you can manage that, go to the north. After that, try to move west. With that done, make an attempt to take a trip west. Then, venture north. With that accomplished, go west. Then, take a trip south. And then, travel east. With that done, travel south. That done, recover the coin from the floor of the scullery. Once that's all handled, you can stop! -= Spare Room =- You find yourself in a spare room. An usual one.
