With that done, attempt to go west. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go to the south. Following that, try to take a trip east. After that, take a trip east. With that accomplished, move east. If you can get around to doing that, travel north. Next, make an attempt to head east. Then, go south. If you can get through with that, make an attempt to venture west. And then, make an effort to venture north. With that accomplished, try to head west. Okay, and then, try to go south. With that accomplished, recover the coin from the floor of the restroom. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Pantry =- You've just shown up in a pantry. You need an unguarded exit?
