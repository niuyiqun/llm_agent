After that, try to move west. With that done, make an attempt to take a trip west. Then, venture north. With that accomplished, go west. Then, take a trip south. And then, travel east. With that done, travel south. That done, recover the coin from the floor of the scullery. Once that's all handled, you can stop! -= Spare Room =- You find yourself in a spare room. An usual one.
