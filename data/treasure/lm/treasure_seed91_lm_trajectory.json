First of all, you could, like, check that the cake scented passageway is unlocked with the cake scented latchkey. Then, ensure that the cake scented passageway in the kitchen is open. After that, go to the east. And then, open the passageway. After that, try to go east. After that, head south. And then, make it so that the hatch is ajar. After that, attempt to go west. Okay, and then, assure that the American style door is unlocked. After that, look and see that the American style door is ajar. Then, head south. And then, make an attempt to venture east. Following that, go south. And then, pick up the cookie from the floor of the dish-pit. Once that's all handled, you can stop! -= Kitchen =- Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building. Were you looking for a freezer? Because look over there, it's a freezer. The freezer is empty, what a horrible day! Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a pan. However, the pan, like an empty pan, has nothing on it. There is a closed cake scented passageway leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
