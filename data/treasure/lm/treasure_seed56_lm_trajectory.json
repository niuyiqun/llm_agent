After that, make an attempt to head east. That done, travel south. And then, look and see that the hatch inside the office is open. And then, make an effort to head south. With that accomplished, open the wooden gate inside the chamber. Then, go to the east. After that, ensure that the pine portal inside the study is open. And then, head north. Okay, and then, open the stone hatch. Then, make an attempt to go north. After that, take the tablet from the recliner. That's it! -= Cubicle =- You've entered a cubicle. You can make out a toolbox.
