And then, doublecheck that the passageway is ajar. And then, travel east. And then, venture east. Then, lift the keycard from the floor of the closet. And then, make an effort to head west. If you can do that, unlock the hatch. And then, ensure that the hatch is open. Then, head north. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an effort to go to the north. Then, venture west. With that done, pick up the grape from the floor of the bathroom. And once you've done that, you win! -= Restroom =- Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the restroom. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a board. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? There is a closed gateway leading east. There is an open portal leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. > -= Restroom =-0/1",
