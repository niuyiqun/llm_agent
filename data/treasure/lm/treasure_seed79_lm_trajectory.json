With that accomplished, make an attempt to move south. Once you get around to doing that, attempt to go to the east. After that, go south. And then, take a trip west. And then, venture west. Once you do that, make an attempt to go north. After that, make an attempt to travel west. Then, retrieve the garlic clove from the floor of the laundry place. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Parlor =- You find yourself in a parlor. A standard one. You make out a safe. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. The couch is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. There is an open hatch leading east. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded. > -= Parlor =-0/1",
