And then, attempt to move east. And then, head east. And then, go to the south. That done, travel west. If you can finish that, venture west. After that, make an attempt to head west. Then, venture south. Okay, and then, make an effort to travel south. With that accomplished, move east. After that, make an attempt to travel north. Then, make an effort to venture east. Next, attempt to take a trip east. And then, pick-up the teacup from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop! -= Garage =- You are in a garage. A normal kind of place.
