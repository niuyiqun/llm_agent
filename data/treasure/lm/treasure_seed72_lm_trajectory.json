After that, pick up the rectangular key from the counter in the cookhouse. After that, unlock the rectangular portal within the cookhouse. After that, ensure that the rectangular portal is open. And then, attempt to take a trip west. With that over with, make an effort to take a trip north. That done, head west. And then, try to head west. And then, attempt to move west. With that over with, make an effort to venture south. Then, make an attempt to move east. Then, try to travel east. With that done, lift the vacuum from the floor of the bathroom. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Cookery =- If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the cookery. The room is well lit. A closed refrigerator is nearby. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a saucepan. The saucepan is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the saucepan. You can make out a chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? There is a closed gateway leading north. There is an open portal leading south. > -= Cookery =-0/1",
