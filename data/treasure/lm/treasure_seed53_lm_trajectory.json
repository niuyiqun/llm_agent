And then, make it so that the Canadian hatch is unlocked with the Canadian keycard. Then, open the Canadian hatch in the scullery. After that, go to the north. And then, make an effort to travel north. And then, pick up the spherical key from the floor of the chamber. If you have picked up the spherical key, make an attempt to travel south. And then, make an attempt to head south. After that, doublecheck that the spherical gate is unlocked. And then, open the spherical gate inside the scullery. Then, try to take a trip west. After that, ensure that the portal is open. And then, attempt to take a trip west. Then, retrieve the key from the saucepan inside the cookery. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Scullery =- You have come into a scullery. Not the scullery you'd expect. No, this is a scullery. There is a closed Canadian hatch leading north. There is a closed spherical gate leading west. There is a Canadian keycard on the floor. > -= Scullery =-0/1",
