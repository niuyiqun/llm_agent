That done, lift the Canadian limited edition key from the floor of the spare room. Then, make an attempt to go to the south. And then, unlock the Canadian limited edition door inside the study. Then, open the Canadian limited edition door within the study. After that, travel west. And then, insert the non-euclidean keycard into the non-euclidean portal's lock to unlock it. Then, make sure that the non-euclidean portal within the studio is open. After that, make an effort to go to the west. Next, venture north. Okay, and then, make an effort to head west. Once you accomplish that, attempt to take a trip north. That done, go north. After that, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the cellar. That's it! -= Study =- You find yourself in a study.
