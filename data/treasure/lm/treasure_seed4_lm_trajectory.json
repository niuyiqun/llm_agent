First thing I need you to do is to unlock the spherical hatch inside the laundry place. After that, make it so that the spherical hatch inside the laundry place is ajar. After that, take a trip north. Next, travel north. If you can finish that, venture east. Following that, go north. After that, go to the west. And then, go to the north. Next, attempt to head east. After that, move east. Then, go south. Once you manage that, make an attempt to head south. And then, head east. And then, lift the insect from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good! -= Laundry Place =- You are in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a laundry place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here. You can see an opened safe, which looks typical, here. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You can see a rack. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well There is a closed spherical hatch leading north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. > -= Laundry Place =-0/1",
