Then, attempt to move east. And then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, make an effort to head north. Following that, make an effort to go west. After that, pick up the keycard from the stand within the attic. After that, try to travel east. If you can accomplish that, unlock the gateway. Then, make absolutely sure that the gateway is ajar. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, head south. That done, retrieve the garlic clove from the fridge in the dish-pit. Once that's all handled, you can stop! -= Shower =- This shower you have just entered is definitely ordinary. You can see a box. You make out a dresser. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a board. The board is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. There is an unguarded exit to the east.
