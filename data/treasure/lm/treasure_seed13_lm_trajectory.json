After that, head west. Next, make an effort to venture west. Following that, make an attempt to go to the west. With that over with, go to the west. And then, travel south. Then, go east. Once you finish that, move south. If you can get through with that, make an effort to venture south. If you can do that, recover the key from the floor of the bar. Alright, thanks! -= Laundromat =- You find yourself in a laundromat. An usual kind of place. You make out a locked safe. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a board. The board is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the board to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored. There is an open gate leading north. There is an unguarded exit to the west. > -= Laundromat =-0/1",
