Then, unlock the non-euclidean passageway. After that, assure that the non-euclidean passageway inside the pantry is open. And then, take a trip north. After that, make an effort to travel north. Then, go east. With that over with, make an attempt to travel east. And then, head east. Then, head east. And then, venture south. After that, go to the south. Then, head south. With that over with, attempt to travel west. If you can finish that, recover the stick of butter from the floor of the closet. That's it! -= Attic =- If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the attic. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure. You make out a stand. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stand?
