But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a mantelpiece. The mantelpiece is usual. However, the mantelpiece, like an empty mantelpiece, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. > -= Austere Office =-0/14",
