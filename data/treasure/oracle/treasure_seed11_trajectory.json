That done, retrieve the non-euclidean latchkey from the bench in the shower. After that, unlock the non-euclidean gate inside the shower. And then, make it so that the non-euclidean gate inside the shower is open. Then, make an attempt to venture east. And then, pick up the cake scented passkey from the floor of the study. If you can get your hands on the cake scented passkey, check that the cake scented gate in the study is unlocked with the cake scented passkey. And then, open the cake scented gate in the study. After that, go to the east. With that accomplished, make an effort to head south. With that done, head east. And then, take a trip east. After that, try to head north. And then, recover the laptop from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Basement =- You've entered a basement. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great. You can make out a cabinet. Huh, weird. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
