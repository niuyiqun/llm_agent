And then, pick up the cake scented passkey from the dresser within the sauna. And then, go to the west. That done, make it so that the cake scented hatch is unlocked. And then, make it so that the cake scented hatch in the garage is open. And then, go to the north. And then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the parlor. Then, make it so that the gate is unlocked. And then, ensure that the gate is open. After that, make an effort to go to the north. Then, attempt to head east. Following that, make an effort to take a trip east. That done, make an attempt to travel east. After that, recover the cloak from the floor of the closet.
