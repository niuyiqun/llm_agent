That done, retrieve the type U passkey from the floor of the cookery. After that, go west. Then, make an effort to head north. After that, look and see that the type U portal within the playroom is unlocked with the type U passkey. After that, ensure that the type U portal is open. And then, attempt to go to the west. With that accomplished, make an effort to head west. And then, make an attempt to go to the south. Following that, move south. With that accomplished, travel east. If you can get around to doing that, travel east. Then, pick-up the blanket from the floor of the salon. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Shower =- You are in a shower. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\" You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
