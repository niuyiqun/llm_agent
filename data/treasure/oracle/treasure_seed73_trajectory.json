Following that, head north. Then, try to travel east. After that, recover the fudge scented passkey from the floor of the bedchamber. With the fudge scented passkey, check that the fudge scented door is unlocked with the fudge scented passkey. After that, make it so that the fudge scented door is ajar. And then, try to move south. After that, attempt to move south. Then, make an attempt to venture south. After that, go to the west. If you can accomplish that, attempt to move north. After that, venture west. Then, pick-up the passkey from the floor of the scullery. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Study =- You've just sauntered into a study. Were you looking for a stand? Because look over there, it's a stand. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.
