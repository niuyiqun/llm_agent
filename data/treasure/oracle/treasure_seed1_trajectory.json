Then, pick up the American latchkey from the floor of the bedchamber. After that, take a trip east. Then, unlock the American gate. And then, make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar. After that, make an attempt to go east. Then, travel east. After that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Spare Room =- I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room. You make out a workbench. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The workbench is typical. However, the workbench, like an empty workbench, has nothing on it. You see a stand. The stand is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. > -= Spare Room =-0/1",
