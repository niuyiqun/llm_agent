Following that, attempt to go east. And then, attempt to go to the north. Then, make an attempt to go west. Once you finish that, look and see that the gateway in the garage is ajar. After that, try to take a trip north. If you can accomplish that, ensure that the wooden portal in the study is open. Having pulled open the wooden portal, try to go to the west. Once you succeed at that, ensure that the passageway inside the cookhouse is open. And then, go to the west. Following that, venture west. Then, recover the latchkey from the case in the cellar. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Closet =- You arrive in a closet. A standard one. You begin looking for stuff. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. > -= Closet =-0/1",
