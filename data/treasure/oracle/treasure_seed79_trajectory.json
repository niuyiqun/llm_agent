Once you do that, make an attempt to go north. After that, make an attempt to travel west. Then, retrieve the garlic clove from the floor of the laundry place. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Parlor =- You find yourself in a parlor. A standard one. You make out a safe. What a letdown! The safe is empty! You bend down to tie your shoe.
