Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You think about smashing the mantle to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored. Oh, great. Here's an armchair. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The armchair is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west. > -= Workshop =-0/12",
