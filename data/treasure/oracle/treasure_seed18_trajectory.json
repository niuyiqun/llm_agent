And then, make an effort to take a trip east. And then, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the oak door in the closet. Then, make an effort to go to the north. And then, make an effort to move west. After that, lift the fresh laundry scented key from the floor of the shower. With the fresh laundry scented key, insert the fresh laundry scented key into the fresh laundry scented door in the shower's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the fresh laundry scented door inside the shower is open. After that, travel north. Then, attempt to move east. After that, open the portal. Then, attempt to head north. Then, pick-up the latchkey from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good! -= Laundromat =- You arrive in a laundromat. An ordinary one. You start to take note of what's in the room. You can see a rack. The rack is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. There is an unblocked exit to the south. > -= Laundromat =-0/1",
