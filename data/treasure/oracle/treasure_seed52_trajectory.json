        "state": "Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could retrieve the passkey from the floor of the steam room. If you can get your hands on the passkey, check that the box is unlocked with the passkey. And then, make absolutely sure that the box is opened. After that, take the rectangular passkey from the box in the steam room. After getting the rectangular passkey, attempt to take a trip east. And then, make sure that the rectangular portal within the washroom is unlocked. And then, ensure that the rectangular portal in the washroom is open. And then, make an effort to head south. Then, ensure that the portal is open. Then, attempt to move west. And then, unlock the passageway with the key. And then, make it so that the passageway is open. After that, make an effort to venture west. If you can manage that, pick up the keycard from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Steam Room =- You arrive in a steam room. You make out a locked box. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is a passkey on the floor. > -= Steam Room =-0/1",
