However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
