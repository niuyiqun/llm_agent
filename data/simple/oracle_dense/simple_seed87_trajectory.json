But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is normal. The stove appears to be empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
