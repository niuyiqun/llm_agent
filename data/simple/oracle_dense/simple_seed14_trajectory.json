It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south.
