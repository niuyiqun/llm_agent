The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
