You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
