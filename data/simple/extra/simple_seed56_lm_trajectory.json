As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
