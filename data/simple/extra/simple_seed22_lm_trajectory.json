But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
