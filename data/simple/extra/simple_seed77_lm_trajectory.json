However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld! There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
