Now that's what I call TextWorld! The refrigerator contains a half of a bag of chips and a lettuce. You see a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. But the thing is empty. This always happens! There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. > -= Kitchen =-1/16",
