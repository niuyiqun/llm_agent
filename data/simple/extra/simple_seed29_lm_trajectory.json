If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
