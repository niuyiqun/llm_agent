Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a kitchen island, go to TextWorld. You see a note on the kitchen island. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
