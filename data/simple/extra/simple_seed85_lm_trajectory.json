You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. But the thing is empty. You can see a stove. The stove is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a kitchen island? You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/13",
