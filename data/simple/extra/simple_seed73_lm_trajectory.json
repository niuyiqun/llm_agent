Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored. There is a closed wooden door leading east. > -= Bedroom =-0/1",
