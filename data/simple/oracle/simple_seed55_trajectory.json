Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
