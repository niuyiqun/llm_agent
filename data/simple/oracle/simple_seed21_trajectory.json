But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
