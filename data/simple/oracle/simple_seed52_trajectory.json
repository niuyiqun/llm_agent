You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
