The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Now that's what I call TextWorld! There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
