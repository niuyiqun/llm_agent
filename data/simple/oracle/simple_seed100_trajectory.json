You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is typical. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the south. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
