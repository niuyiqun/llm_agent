When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies! There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. > -= Kitchen =-2/9",
