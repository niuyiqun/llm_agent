The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the counter to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored. You make out a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/11",
