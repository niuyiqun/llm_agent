Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
