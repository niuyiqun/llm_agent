The counter is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
