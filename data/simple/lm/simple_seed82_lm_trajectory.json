You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
