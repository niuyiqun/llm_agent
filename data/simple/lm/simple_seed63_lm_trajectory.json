It looks like it's a counter. The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/12",
