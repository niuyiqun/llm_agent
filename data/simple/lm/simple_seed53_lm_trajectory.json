You see a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. Your score has just gone up by one point. > -= Kitchen =-1/11",
