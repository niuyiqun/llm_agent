Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great. You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed. There is a closed wooden door leading east. > -= Bedroom =-0/1",
