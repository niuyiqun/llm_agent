The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building. You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors?
