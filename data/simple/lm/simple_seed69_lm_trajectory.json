The refrigerator contains a lettuce. Oh, great. Here's a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a stove. The stove is usual. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. > -= Kitchen =-1/16",
