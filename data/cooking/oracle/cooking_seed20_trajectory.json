An open fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. The fridge contains a fried white tuna, a fried block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion and a parsley. You check the price tag that the fridge's owner still hasn't taken off. Eighty big ones?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my buddy, they work for the post office? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 20 bucks! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a tomato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
