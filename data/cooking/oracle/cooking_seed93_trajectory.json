The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a fried red tuna, a red bell pepper and a raw white tuna. You can see a closed oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. You see a cookbook on the table, so there's that. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a green hot pepper, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
