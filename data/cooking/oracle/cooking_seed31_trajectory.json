You begin to take stock of what's in the room. You can make out a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains a white onion and a block of cheese. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried tomato, a fried banana and a yellow apple. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
