You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a red onion and an orange bell pepper! You make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted yellow potato, a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a green apple, a cookbook and a knife. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
