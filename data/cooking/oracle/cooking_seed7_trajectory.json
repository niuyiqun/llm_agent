You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a lettuce and a parsley. You can make out a closed oven right there by you. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a roasted red hot pepper, a tomato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow apple, a green bell pepper and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? There is an open plain door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
