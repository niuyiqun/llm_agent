The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a red onion and a cilantro. You see a closed oven right there by you. You can see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a tomato on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-1/7",

The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a red onion and a cilantro. You see a closed oven right there by you. You can see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a tomato on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-1/7",
