You can see a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a roasted red tuna, a red onion, a raw white tuna and a white onion. You can make out an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You see a counter. You see a roasted green apple, a red apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a cookbook on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
