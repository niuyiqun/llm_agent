You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried purple potato, a yellow apple and a raw red potato. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-1/7",
