You see a fridge. The fridge contains a fried yellow onion, a fried red onion, a raw red tuna and a yellow bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. You can make out a table. On the table you see a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
