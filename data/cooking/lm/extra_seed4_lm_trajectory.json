Once done, enjoy your meal! -= Kitchen =- This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. There is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
