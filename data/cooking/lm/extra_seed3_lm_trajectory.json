The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted green bell pepper, a green hot pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven nearby. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/10",
