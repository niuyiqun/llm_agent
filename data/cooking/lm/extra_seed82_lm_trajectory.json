An usual kind of place. You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a fried yellow onion, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You make out a closed oven nearby. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. You see a fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a red apple, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
