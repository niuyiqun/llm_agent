You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a green apple and a yellow bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. There is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-2/12",
