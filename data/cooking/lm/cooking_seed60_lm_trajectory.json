The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building. You see a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a parsley, a green bell pepper, a white onion and a raw pork chop. You see an oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a banana, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a green hot pepper, a tomato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
