The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a yellow apple and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a fried green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-0/10",
