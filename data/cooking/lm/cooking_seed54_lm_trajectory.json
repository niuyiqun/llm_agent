You can make out a closed oven in the corner. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a tomato and a banana. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. > -= Kitchen =-0/5",
