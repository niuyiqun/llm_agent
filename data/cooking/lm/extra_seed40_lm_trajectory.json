The fridge contains a white onion, a roasted red bell pepper, a lettuce, a carrot, a red apple, a green bell pepper, a raw white tuna, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/9",
