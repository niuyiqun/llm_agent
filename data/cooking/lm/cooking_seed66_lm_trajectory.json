You begin to take stock of what's in the room. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a roasted green apple, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
