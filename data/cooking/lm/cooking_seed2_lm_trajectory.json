The fridge contains a roasted red onion, a cilantro, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion, a block of cheese and a raw pork chop. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a tomato and a cookbook. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/2",
