You see a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Sixty bucks?! That's ridiculous! You ever meet my buddy, they work for the post office? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a fried red tuna, a red apple, a green bell pepper, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a green apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. There is an open plain door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
