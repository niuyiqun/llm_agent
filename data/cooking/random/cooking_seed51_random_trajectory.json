On the counter you can make out a fried yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You make out a stove. You see a knife on the stove. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/26",
