Once done, enjoy your meal! -= Kitchen =- If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement. You see a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a red onion, a yellow onion, a block of cheese, a raw red tuna, a white onion and a cilantro. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted yellow apple, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper and a red apple. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. > -= Kitchen =-0/1",
