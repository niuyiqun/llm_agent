The fridge contains a roasted red bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted red potato, a raw red tuna and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. > -= Kitchen =-0/14",
