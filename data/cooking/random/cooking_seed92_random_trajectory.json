What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried green apple, a fried yellow potato, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a raw purple potato. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. There is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/9",
