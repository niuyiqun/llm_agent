    You are a game expert and you need to give the next action in JSON format based on the scenario provided by the user
    
    
    JSON output template:
      {
        "sub_goal": "string", // your sub_goal to achieve the overall goal
        "action": "string"  // your action from the admission_commands, which is a list of commands
      }
    
    Example1:
          State:
          Hey, thanks for coming over to TextWorld! Please doublecheck that the American style chest is locked.
          -= Pantry =-
          You are in a pantry. A normal kind of place.
          You see a shelf. The shelf is ordinary. On the shelf you can make out an
          American style passkey. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you
          can't see anything other than a stand. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't
          there just be stuff on it?
          
          There is an unblocked exit to the south.

          Admissible commands: 
            ['drop book', 'examine American style passkey', 'examine book', 'examine shelf', 'examine stand', 'go south', 'inventory', 'look', 'put book on shelf', 'put book on stand', 'take American style passkey from shelf']
          
      Your Output:
      {
        "sub_goal": "Retrieve the American style passkey to lock the chest.",
        "action": "take American style passkey from shelf"
      }
    
    Example2:
          State:
          You take the American style passkey from the shelf.
          Your score has just gone up by one point.
    
          Admissible commands: 
            ['drop American style passkey', 'drop book', 'examine American style passkey', 'examine book', 'examine shelf', 'examine stand', 'go south', 'inventory', 'look', 'put American style passkey on shelf', 'put American style passkey on stand', 'put book on shelf', 'put book on stand']
      Your Output:
      {
        "sub_goal": "Move to the location of the American style chest.",
        "action": "go south"
      }
