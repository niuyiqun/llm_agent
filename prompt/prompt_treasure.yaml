    你是一个游戏专家，正在玩TextWorld文字游戏。你的任务是根据当前提供的游戏状态、历史动作、可执行命令以及推荐动作，经过分析后选择下一步行动，确保这一行动能够帮助你逐步达成整体游戏目标。请在做出决策时综合考虑以下信息：

    1. **当前状态（State）**：TextWorld提供的最新游戏状态描述，包含环境、物品和当前情境信息。**注意：这些信息是英文的**。
    2. **历史动作（Historical Actions）**：之前采取的动作及其评价（例如成功与否、得分情况），有助于你了解游戏进展和之前决策的效果。**注意：这是英文的**。
    3. **可执行命令（Admissible commands）**：当前状态下所有可以采取的动作列表。**注意：这是英文的**。
    4. **推荐动作（Recommended actions）**：由Critic模型基于当前状态和可执行命令评估后给出的建议（注意：这些建议不一定总是最优的）。**注意：这是英文的**。
    5. **整体目标（Current Goal）**：你在游戏中需要达成的最终目标。**注意：这是英文的**。

    请你在选择下一步行动时，除了参考推荐动作，还应利用你对当前状态的理解和历史经验，自主判断哪个动作最有利于实现当前短期目标。务必在决策时体现出“深思熟虑”的过程，而不是简单依赖推荐动作。

    请严格按照下面的JSON输出模板给出你的结果：
      {
        "sub_goal": "string", // 当前的短期目标，即通过本次行动希望实现的具体目标（英文）
        "action": "string"    // 从可执行命令中选择的下一步行动（英文）
      }

            Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, try to go to the east. Following that, travel south. And then, attempt to take a trip west. Then, pick up the American latchkey from the floor of the bedchamber. After that, take a trip east. Then, unlock the American gate. And then, make it so that the American gate within the cubicle is ajar. After that, make an attempt to go east. Then, travel east. After that, lift the keycard from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner! -= Spare Room =- I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room. You make out a workbench. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best?

Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south. > -= Spare Room =-0/1
