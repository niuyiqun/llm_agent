Following that, venture east. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, move north. Following that, attempt to move west. After that, take a trip west. Then, take the fudge scented latchkey from the shelf inside the cookery. And then, unlock the fudge scented portal within the cookery. Then, ensure that the fudge scented portal within the cookery is open. Then, head west. After that, venture south. Then, lift the stick of butter from the floor of the office.
