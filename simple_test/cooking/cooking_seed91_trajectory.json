You can see a closed oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door?
