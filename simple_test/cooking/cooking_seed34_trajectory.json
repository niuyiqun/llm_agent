The fridge contains a roasted block of cheese and a raw white tuna. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a yellow apple, so there's that. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. > -= Kitchen =-0/3",
