But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
