It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for
today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to retrieve the
American style passkey from the shelf. After you have got the American style
passkey, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to move east.
Following that, close the American style chest in the attic. Once you have
closed the American style chest, look and see that the American style chest is
locked with the American style passkey. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A normal kind of place.

You see a shelf. The shelf is ordinary. On the shelf you can make out an

can't see anything other than a stand. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't
there just be stuff on it?

There is an unblocked exit to the south.

The American style chest contains a top hat. You can make out a workbench. The
workbench is usual. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there
was stuff on the workbench! oh well.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a lightbulb on the floor.
